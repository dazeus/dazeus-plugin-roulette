# DaZeus Roulette
Randomly shoots you or maybe it doesn't if you're lucky! Provides the commands `}load-gun`
to start a new game, `}pull` to pull the trigger and hope you don't get shot. Finally you
can also use `}roulette` to try your luck once, outside of a game.


## Installation

    npm install dazeus-plugin-roulette

## Running it
If you don't need to change anything, just run this inside the directory it is installed in:

    node index

However some command line options are available, use this to see what is available:

    node index --help
